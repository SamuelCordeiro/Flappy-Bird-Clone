## About the project

The project is based on the famous FlapBird game, developed on the Unity engine.

The game currently has only one screen, this is the screen where the game is played.

When the player touches a pipe or the ground the game is finished and the same game screen is shown in the game over menu.

From that menu it is possible to restart the game.
